Problems that I faced:

1. CSS for the moving bar at the top.
2. Getting images in the right sizes and proportions.
3. Dynamic elements of the website(video graphics, list at the end etc).
4. Alignment, sizing, and, placing of SVGs.
5. Timing of the animations.
6. Video embedding (the layout and the popup).
7. Alignment and placing of child elements inside the flexbox elements.
8. Interactive parts of the website(that require JS).
9. Problems with responsiveness:
  a. Divs kept going off-screen.
  b. Image proportions for changing screen size.
  c. Getting items into a certain number of rows using Flexbox.
  d. Sizing, proportions, and, alignment of items when changing resolution.
  e. Interactive parts of the website(require JS).
